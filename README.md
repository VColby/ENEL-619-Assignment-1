Authours: Colby Valcourt, Suleman Osman | Group 02

Kernel used: Python 3.11.14 via anaconda3

Instructions: Using Kernel 3.11.14, run each task, ensuring the .csv data files remain in the same directory so they may be called by the code file. All necessary libraries are called at the beginning of each code file. 

NOTE: If a plot does not show the upper limit, the code line was commented out for visual aid. Otherwise, all lines of code were included as per the instructions in the handout.

This code was produced using the kernel mentioned above in VSCode.
