Kernel used: Python 3.11.14 via anaconda3

Instructions: Using Kernel 3.11.14, run each task, ensuring the .csv data files remain in the same directory so they may be called by the code file. All necessary libraries are called at the beginning of each code file.

This code was produced using the kernel mentioned above in VSCode.


AI Statement: Chatgpt was used to help produce the plots in Task 1: Temporal Dispatch, which was then applied to the remaining plots and modified as needed by ourselves.
